                            ANMOL KHARB loves a good one-liner, and doesn’t particularly care about traditional festivals if they come in the way of her badminton practice. On Diwali, she demanded to know from coach Kusum Singh why she couldn’t pack in a morning training session when all the revelry and fireworks happen in the evening. And on Rakshabandhan, she coolly declared, “I’ll protect myself. I don’t need rakhi.”

                        <p>
                            Talking to an AI chatbot can feel a bit like Groundhog Day after a while, as you tell it for the umpteenth time how you like your emails formatted and which of those “fun things to do this weekend” you’ve already done six times. OpenAI is trying to fix that and personalize its own bot in a big way. It’s rolling out “memory” for ChatGPT, which will allow the bot to remember information about you and your conversations over time.
